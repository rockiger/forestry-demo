_Starting_ with Linux on your laptop and want to know which apps you should use? Or you want to find better alternatives for the apps you already use? This guide gives you apps for almost everything you need on a Linux machine.

I have listed apps I use personally on my Linux laptop – they are a mostly open source, all free and awesome.

To install these apps refer to your distro’s package manager.

Right now I have no apps included for tasks I don’t need to do. For this reason is why there is no video editor app and no instant messaging – feel free to add them in the comments. Also, I didn’t include websites I use, like Google Calendar and Gmail – tell me if you want me to cover them.

I also didn’t include apps that are usually an integral part of your Linux distribution like your desktop environment and your file manager. Personally, I like KDE, but the apps I listed work great with any desktop environment. Internet

## Firefox

Firefox is the free web browser of the Mozilla project. It has a lot of extensions to customize your web experience and feels more lightweight than Chromium.

## Chromium

Chromium is the free variant of Chrome. It is a slick web browser with a minimal user interface and tons of extensions. Unlike Chrome, it doesn’t come with Flash and closed source codecs. A nice feature is that you can save a specific website to your application menu.

## THUNDERBIRD

Thunderbird is the free E-Mail-Client from Mozilla. Like Firefox, Thunderbird is very customizable and has a lot of extensions.

Office

## LIBREOFFICE

LibreOffice is the office suite for Linux. All alternatives leave a lot to be desired for serious work. Since it’s fork from OpenOffice LibreOffice’s development pace is growing steadily. If you are searching for OpenOffice use LibreOffice.

TYPORA

Typora is a very sleek looking Markdown editor. Unlike most other Markdown editors it has no preview window the edit view, but a What You See Is What You Get interface.

Text Editors

ATOM

Atom is a text editor created with web technologies. It is very customizable, has a lot of extensions availabl[e and should be more familiar to a new user than Emacs. On the downside, it is quite heavy on your](euiaeuiae "uiaeiae") system’s resources; especially if you are using a lot of extensions like I do.

EMACS

Emacs is an extensible, customizable editor from the GNU project. It is probably the most powerful text editor there. On the other side, emacs started in 1984 and has a lot of idiosyncrasies. This is why the learning curve is really steep. I personally recommend looking into Spacemacs or ErgoEmacs for easing the experience.

Todo-List

AKIEE

> This is a shameless plug; I am the author of Akiee, but I really think Akiee is one of the best task managers out there. It is based on the Kanban method and makes it easy to prioritize your tasks and on concentrating on what to do next.

ORG-MODE

Org-Mode is a particular mode in Emacs that gives you the possibility of note taking, planning and outlining. Many say it alone makes it worth to learn Emacs. For people who don’t use Emacs, it is a considerable time investment to learn Emacs and Org-mode.

Note-Keeping

ZIM

Zim is a personal wiki that makes it very easy to keep your notes. It makes it very easy to connect and organize your notes. It comes with several extensions for your documentation needs.

LEO

Leo is an outlining application, that looks very interesting for people who have to write a lot of text. It can be used for note-taking, outlining and even literate programming. Like a lot of powerful tools, it needs some time to get into it.

BASKET

Basket is a very powerful note taking application. It comes with a lot more features than Zim but has a steeper learning curve.

FREEMIND

FreeMind is a powerful Mindmapping software that is easy to use and available for all major platforms. If you are into Mindmaps, FreeMind is for you.

Developer-Tools

VIRTUALBOX

If you need a virtualization solution on your desktop VirtualBox is the easiest way to get one. There are other solutions for Linux, but they are not as easy to use.

SMARTGIT

SmartGit in an easy to use, full-featured Git GUI. It is not open source but free to use for personal use.

Security

KEEPASSX

Using a password manager is probably the number one action you can do to improve your security on the Internet. KeePassX is the best working solution for me so far.

Multimedia

VLC

VLC is one of the most famous multimedia players out there. And for a reason. It plays almost every kind of multimedia file. If you have trouble with your pre-installed media player give VLC a try.

SPOTIFY DESKTOP

Spotify desktop is not a great piece of software, but if you are a Spotify user, there is no better option out there.

Graphics

GIMP

Gimp is your solution for an in-depth graphics editor for Linux. It can do most things Photoshop can do. Most people need to get used to the user interface if they come from other graphics software.

INKSCAPE

Inkscape is a vector graphics editor, that can be used for professional designs. It has flexible drawing tools, can import a lot of file formats (including pdf) and has a powerful text tool.

SCRIBUS

Scribus is a professional desktop publishing system to create booklets, brochures, magazines and everything that’s printed.

Education

ANKI

Anki is an intelligent flashcard app, which makes it easy to repeat and to remember things. With Anki, you can learn much more efficiently languages and facts.

Games

STEAM

Steam is a distribution platform for computer games. You can get about 160 commercial games for Linux on Steam. If you want serious gaming on Linux, you need Steam.

FROZEN BUBBLE

Frozen Bubble is a cute and colorful logical game. It has a high-quality soundtrack and can be quite addictive.

FREECIV

FreeCiv is a free and open source Civilization clone. If you like the original, you will like Freeciv.

Productivity

CLIPIT

ClipIt is a lightweight clipboard manager. If your desktop environment doesn’t have one included like Gnome, you definitely should use one. It will do wonders for your productivity.

ALBERT

Albert is a productivity app that will boost your efficiency for launching apps, searching files, browse your bookmark and even calculate simple arithmetic.

AUTOKEY

AutoKey is a desktop automation utility. It allows you to manage a collection of scripts and phrases, and assign abbreviations and hotkeys to these. AutoKey will enable you to execute a script or insert text on demand in whatever program you are using.

QTerminal

QTerminal is a very lightweight tiling terminal emulator. Its highlight is that you can create multiple planes by splitting them into any layout you want. This is very practical if you need several terminal windows open. Gnome, Xfce, Ubuntu and Mint users can use Tilix, that is better integrated with their desktop environment.

Yukuake is a terminal that drops down from the top of the screen when pressing a specific shortcut. Yukuake is very useful if you want to type a short command in your terminal without opening a new window on your desktop. Gnome, Xfce, Ubuntu and Mint users can look at Guake, that is better integrated their desktop environment.

SYNERGY

Synergy is a special tool you can use to share the mouse and keyboard of different computers. Just go to the edge of your computer with your mouse pointer and move it seamlessly to your next computer – like a second screen.

Emulators

Wine Icon

Wine

Wine is a Windows-compatible runtime environment for Linux. That means you can run a lot of Windows-software on your Linux machine. I use it to run an old version of OpenOffice that I need for using a particular German spell checker.

PlayOnLinux Icon

PlayOnLinux

PlayOnLinux is a graphical user interface for Wine. It makes it much easier to install software and administer different Wine versions.
